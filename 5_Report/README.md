# Project Idea
While Searching for the title of mini project . This project idea came across me. I do the research and start working on this project by getting help from open source materials. 
## Brief Descreption about this project
In this project I tried to make a digital register for medical store shop or hospital.
By using this register one can easily perform the 5 following tasks to manage the inventory of medicine
1. **Add Medicine:** By using this function one can add a new medicine in the inventory by putting its ID , Name, Manufacturer, Mfg and Exp date, Quantity, and Price
2. **Delete Medicine:** By using this function one can easily delete the medicine by just entering its ID number, if the stock of that particular medicine gets over
3. **Update Medicine:** By using this function one can update the all the details of any medicine just by getting its ID
4. **Search Medicine:** By using this function one can find out the availability of any medicine by entering its ID
5. **Show Medicine:** By using this function one can list all the available medicine on the display.

By using this product medical shop owner may get rid of the heavy and bulky register. Because now a days maintaining a physical register is more challenging.
This project is also ecofriendly because it restricts the paper wastage hence save the trees.
