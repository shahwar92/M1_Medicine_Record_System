## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. **compilation error:** installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.
2. **Makefile:** To overcome this problem use tab instead of space.
3. **Unity testing:** Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
